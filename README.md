# todoapp-fatfish
Simple to do list app for technical assessment for Fat Fish Digital

## Setup instructions:
[insert instructions to deploy/run code here]


## Project plan/starting points:
- Setup CRUD API in Node.js/TypeScript with Express/MongoDB
- To do object should have title, description, due date, created date, priority, completed status
- Set up Jest testing framework
- Research Serverless & necessary setup to deploy
- Set up React Native frontend
- Components should include todo item, expanded todo card, checkbox, list container
- Research Redux

## Thoughts on:

### Data storage

### Auth

### Automated testing

### Monorepo/separate repos

### Code structure

### Code linting


Brief:
Our tech stack is as follows:
● Core
○ Node.js with TypeScript
○ Git Version Control via GitHub
○ Jest
○ ESLint

● Backend
○ Amazon Web Services/Azure
○ Relational and Non-Relational Databases
○ Serverless Framework
○ Headless CMSes like Prismic and Sanity
○ Low-Code/No-Code platforms like Xano

● Frontend
○ React Native for mobile apps on iOS and Android
○ React for web
○ Redux

Using the tech stack described above, produce a simple To Do list project (or similar). 
You are not expected to use the full stack, but it should be written in TypeScript and include the following:
1. CRUD API written in TypeScript that can be deployed via Serverless to AWS
2. React Native mobile app that interacts with your CRUD API, and utilizes Redux state management

We should be able to view your project in a GitHub repository/repositories and be able to deploy and run your code. Please include any instructions for us to do this in a README.md.

We are not judging your UI design skills so don’t worry how it looks, we want to see the components you use for your solution and clean, well structured code.

Remember, your project can be kept very basic! However, bonus points are on offer for either implementing or including your thoughts in your README.md on the following:

● Data storage on both the front and back end. This could be backed by file storage, a non-relational database, secure device storage, in memory stores or anything else that
makes sense
● Authentication between the front and back end
● Automated testing tools: Think Jest. You don't need to build a CI/CD pipeline!
● Monorepo or separate repos
● Project/code structure
● Code Linting
